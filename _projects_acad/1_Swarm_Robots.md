In this project, geometric shapes are formed by synchronous, fat robots with limited visibility. Initially, these robots were made move to the circumference of a circle. [This](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-16-5207-3_54) describes the algorithm.

This algorithm was extended to work for multiple circles and arbitrary shapes.
