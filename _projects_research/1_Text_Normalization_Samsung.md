Text Normalization plays important role in all NLP pipeline. It is used to convert different representation of an entity into a single cannonical form. 
Weighted finite state transducers were used for this problem. [This](https://mainak-biswas1999.github.io/files/LiteratureTN_FSTs_Transducers_updated.pdf) describes the technical details.
