This was a 4 month-long rigorous (2 sessions per week) course introducing undergraduates and AI enthusiasts to Machine learning. It consists of 24 sessions of instruction (totalling 54 hours) and 4 assignments (12 hours). In the first 12 sessions, we built the foundations to understand machine learning – Probability and Statistics, and Linear Algebra. All these topics were covered rigorously, and the GATE syllabus was addressed completely for these subjects. In the next 12 sessions, we covered foundational Machine Learning and Optimization for undergraduates and beginners. This course would be particularly useful for people who want to write the Graduate Aptitude Test for Engineers (GATE) Data Science and AI paper. We also showed how to code several ML algorithms in Python from scratch. Furthermore, the assignments would further help them grasp the concepts through theory and coding in python. This course covers all the AI topics and Mathematics related topics in the syllabus:
