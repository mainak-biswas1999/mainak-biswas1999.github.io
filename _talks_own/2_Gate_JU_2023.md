In October 2023, I spoke about pursuing a career in academia at the first year UG students' orientation programme in the department of Information Technology, Jadavapur University, Kolkata. The talk comprised self-preparation statergies for writing the GATE examination for Computer Science, and Data Science and AI papers; and preparing for higher education abroad.

I also demostrated the importance of mathematics in the fields of Computer Science and AI, giving introductory tutorials on topics like linear algebra and applications of calculus.
